/**
 * Connected-worker registry for the router's worker transport (ADR-003 §2). A
 * process-local map of `workerId → live /worker/stream WSContext`, plus the
 * server→worker push primitive the control plane uses to hand a
 * `ControlPlaneMessage` (the `TaskAssignment` the dispatcher composes — issue
 * #407, `./dispatcher.ts`) to a specific connected daemon.
 *
 * Factored out of the socket glue (`./worker-transport.ts`) so it is unit-testable
 * with a fake `WSContext` and never needs a live socket — the same reason
 * `handleHandshake`/`handleWorkerStreamFrame` are already factored, and mirroring
 * the module-level registry in `../worker/run-cancellation.ts`. The `Map` is
 * module-private; callers touch it only through the exported functions.
 *
 * Single-process assumption: the MVP router runs as one process and a worker is
 * connected to exactly one router instance, so this in-process map is a complete
 * view of who is reachable *from here*. Multi-process/multi-router fan-out (a
 * shared routing table) is out of scope and belongs to a later phase.
 *
 * This module owns no scheduling decision. Register/deregister keep the map in step
 * with the socket lifecycle; `sendToWorker` is the primitive the control-plane
 * dispatcher (`./dispatcher.ts`) calls to push a composed `TaskAssignment`, and
 * `isWorkerConnected` is the transport-connectivity predicate the eligibility gate
 * folds in so only socket-connected workers are selected (issue #407).
